# Alien Invasion

A python version of the classic game _Space Invaders_.   
This game was built following instructions from the book _[Python Crash Course](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Python-Crash-Course-Hands-Project-Based-ebook/dp/B018UXJ9RI)_ by Eric Matthes.  
I make no claim to intellectual rights and this was undertaken as an exercise in learing programing in Python.
